This is my Softwware Engineering Course project aims to tackle one of the fashion industry’s most pressing problems — textile waste. It introduces an IoT-based software solution capable of detecting, classifying, and managing garment waste generated during production. By integrating machine learning, computer vision, and data analytics, the system identifies recyclable materials in real time and supports recycling initiatives to promote a sustainable circular economy in the textile sector.

Developed using the Scrum methodology, this system ensures iterative development, rapid feedback, and adaptability to evolving environmental and industrial needs. The platform provides functionalities such as:

🧩 Real-time monitoring of IoT-connected sensors

📊 Waste detection, classification, and reporting

🔁 Recycling management and tracking

🔐 Secure user authentication and control panel

🌐 Device connectivity and search capabilities

This project bridges technology and sustainability — a digital stride toward greener, smarter textile production.
